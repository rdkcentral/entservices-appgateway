    //      memory even after the last Release — the test process exits
    //      shortly after, and the OS reclaims the memory.
    //
    // Why no self-delete:  some tests allocate MockEmitter on the stack via
    // Core::Sink<MockEmitter>.  Self-deleting a stack object is undefined
    // behaviour.  By omitting self-delete we keep both usage patterns safe.
