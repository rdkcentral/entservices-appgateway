  # Coverity native full build job for entservices-appgateway.
  # This workflow was previously disabled via an `if: false` guard and is now
  # re-enabled to restore native Coverity analysis coverage in CI. It runs a full
  # dependency build followed by `cov_build.sh` to generate Coverity build
  # artifacts for static analysis of the entservices-appgateway component on
  # main, sprint, release, and develop branches (and their pull requests).
